Reconnaissance
  Reconnaisscance in information Security is a process of information gathering about target System or Network, often done by Ethical hacker 
  there are two types of Recon based on interaction 
      1. Active recon 
      2. Passive recon

 Active Recon : In which involues direct interaction with traget
 Passive Recon : which involues no interaction with target, Used public available information of target

Footprinting?
      footprinting is a first step and process of information gathering in which involoves making a blue print of target way  to infilterate
Types of Footprinting . It look more Passive way 
    Passive Footprinting
        Collects information without directly interacting with the target.
Examples:
                            
              Maltego – Visual link analysis tool for mapping relationships and gathering intel.
              Recon-ng – Web reconnaissance framework (like Metasploit for info gathering).
              theHarvester – Gathers emails, domains, usernames, IPs from public sources.
              Shodan – Search engine for internet-connected devices (reveals exposed systems).
              Google Dorks – Advanced search techniques to find sensitive data on Google.
              WHOIS Lookup – Gets domain registration details (owners, emails, etc.).
              Nslookup / Dig – Retrieves DNS records (MX, A, TXT, etc.)
              Wayback Machine – View historical versions of websites to find exposed info.
              Censys – Security search engine like Shodan, useful for host metadata.
              Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) – Can aid in social engineering by analyzing open-source data.
    Active Footprinting
        Involves direct interaction with the target system.
        Examples: Port scanning, traceroute, ping sweeps, and banner grabbing.

Fingerprinting ?
      fingerprinting is second step and process of information gathering in which involues what kind of software , technology , security used
types of fingerprinting . It look Active way
