      2. Passive recon

 Active Recon : In which involues direct interaction with traget
 Passive Recon : which involues no interaction with target, Used public available information of target

Footprinting?
      footprinting is a first step and process of information gathering in which involoves making a blue print of target way  to infilterate
Types of Footprinting . It look more Passive way 
    Passive Footprinting

        Involves direct interaction with the target system.
        Examples: Port scanning, traceroute, ping sweeps, and banner grabbing.
