Reconnaissance
  Reconnaisscance in information Security is a process of information gathering about target System or Network, often done by Ethical hacker 
    There are two types of Recon based on interaction 
      1. Active recon 
      2. Passive recon
 
 Active Recon : In which involues direct interaction with traget.
        Examples: Port scanning, traceroute, ping sweeps, and banner grabbing.
 Passive Recon : which involues no interaction with target, Used public available information of target  


    Phase of Reconaissance 
       1.Footprinting    : General public info (external view)
       2.fingerprinting   : Identify OS, apps, software versions
       3.Scanning  : 	Detect live hosts, ports, services
       4.Enumration : 	Extract internal data (users, shares)

Footprinting ?
      footprinting is a first step and process of information gathering in which involoves making a blue print of target way  to infilterate. It look more Passive way 
Types of Footprinting : Active Footprinting, Passive Footprinting  
 Examples:
              Maltego – Visual link analysis tool for mapping relationships and gathering intel.
              Recon-ng – Web reconnaissance framework (like Metasploit for info gathering).
              theHarvester – Gathers emails, domains, usernames, IPs from public sources.
              Shodan – Search engine for internet-connected devices (reveals exposed systems).
              Google Dorks – Advanced search techniques to find sensitive data on Google.
              WHOIS Lookup – Gets domain registration details (owners, emails, etc.).
              Nslookup / Dig – Retrieves DNS records (MX, A, TXT, etc.)
              Wayback Machine – View historical versions of websites to find exposed info.
              Censys – Security search engine like Shodan, useful for host metadata.
              Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) – Can aid in social engineering by analyzing open-source data.

Fingerprinting ?
      Fingerprinting is second step and process of information gathering in which involues what kind of software , technology , security used
types of fingerprinting . It look Active way 
 Example :
              Nmap – Network scanner for port scanning, OS detection, and service versioning.
              XProbe2 – OS detection tool using fuzzy logic (alternative to Nmap).
              p0f – Passive OS fingerprinting by sniffing traffic (no packets sent).
              Netcat – Reads/writes data across networks; can be used for banner grabbing.
              Banner Grabbing with Telnet/Netcat – Manually connects to ports to read service info.
              Wireshark – Network protocol analyzer; can be used for passive fingerprinting.
              AMAP – Application mapper to identify application protocols on open ports.
              WhatWeb – Identifies web technologies (CMS, servers, etc.).
              Wappalyzer – Browser plugin to identify web technologies passively.
              TCP/IP Stack Fingerprinting Tools – Tools like RFP’s techniques or built into IDS/IPS.

Scanning ?
        Scanning is third step and process of information gathering this involues finding which actively probe live system, open-ports, services.
